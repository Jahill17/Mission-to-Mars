# Mission-to-Mars
HTML Web scraping activity on Mars data to create Flask web app using Python and MongoDB.

To do this requires the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
