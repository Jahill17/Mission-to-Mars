# Mission-to-Mars
HTML Web scraping activity on Mars data to create Flask web app using Python and MongoDB.

## Overview
The ultimate goal is to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this requires the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Software Used
- MongoDB
- PyMongo
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Pandas
- Beatifulsoup
- Splinter
- ChromeDriverManager
- Flask
- Bootstrap 3
